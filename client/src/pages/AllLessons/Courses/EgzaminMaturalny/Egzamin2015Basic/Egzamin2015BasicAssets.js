But the authorities said the tower would become another icon for the city and it would cause no harm to the visual panorama of London.","p2":"The building is in the form of a pyramid and it is the largest structure in Europe. The glass tower has 72 floors and it looks like a rocket ready to be launched into space at any moment. The skyscraper stands in the heart of London, on the south bank of the river Thames near Tower Bridge.","p3":"The building is covered with the so-called ‘extra white’ glass. It reflects the sky more than most traditional skyscrapers. That’s why it looks different from season to season and at different times of the day. In certain weather conditions you might have the impression that the upper levels of the building are missing.","p4":"The Shard is owned almost completely by the State of Qatar and the owners decided that the building should serve many functions. There are offices, luxury apartments, restaurants and a five-star hotel.
